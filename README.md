# Caesar Cipher

## Description
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique used to encode messages by shifting the letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This project provides a Python implementation of both encryption and decryption functionalities using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt messages.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Non-alphabetic characters are preserved as-is.
- Input validation for user-friendly interaction.

## Installation
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system. Then clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zeousultra/Caesar_Cipher.git
cd Caesar_Cipher
```

## Usage
Run the script using:

```bash
python3 caesar_cipher.py
```

Follow the prompts to:
1. Choose to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Enter your message.
3. Enter the shift value.

### Example
```
Would you like to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt a message? e
Enter your message: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 5

Encrypted Message: Mjqqt, Btwqi!
```
